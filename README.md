# Fintech Anomaly Detection

Financial technology, or Fintech, is a thriving paradigm on the worldwide scale. With the rise of online transactions, the use of IT for financial service automation is becoming increasingly important. However, because Fintech transactions involve information, ensuring security becomes critical. Vulnerabilities in such systems expose them to fraudulent acts, which cause significant harm to both clients and providers. As a result, techniques from the field of Machine Learning (ML) are being used to detect anomalies in Fintech applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML methods can be used to discover long-term dependencies in multivariate data, and anomalous behaviour can be detected more precisely than traditional statistical methods. In this project, I used a long-short-term memory (LSTM) to detect anomalous behaviours in publicly available Dogecoin historical data.
