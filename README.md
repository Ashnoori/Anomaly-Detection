# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the detection of unusual items, events, or observations that stand out from the rest of the data. AnomoalousÂ data is typically linked to a problem or rare event, such as bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects, malfunctioning equipment, and so on. Anomalies are deviations from the intended system operation that can result in decreased efficiency or complete system failure. Since the causes of anomalies are frequently unknown due to complex system dynamics, effective anomaly detection is necessary. Multivariate time-series data with a contextual spatial attribute has a wide range of applications for detecting anomalous patterns, including earth science, hurricane tracking, fraud detection, and disease outbreak detection. Anomalous dynamics are mostly unknown and occur inadvertently. They cause instabilities and, as a result, increase inefficiencies and system errors. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to discover long-term dependencies in multivariate data, and anomalous behaviour can be detected more precisely than traditional statistical methods. In this project, I used a long-short-term memory (LSTM) to detect anomalous behaviours in publicly available Dogecoin historical data.
